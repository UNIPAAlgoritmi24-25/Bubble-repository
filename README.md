### üîÑ Sorting Algorithms
- **Algorithms**: MergeSort, QuickSort, InsertionSort, BubbleSort, CountingSort
- **Interactive testing** with manual input, file upload, or random generation
- **Automatic performance comparison** with charts and tables

### üìä Data Structures
- **Linked Lists** - Complete operations (insert, search, delete, min, max, predecessor, successor)
- **Binary Search Trees** - All BST operations with visualization
- **Red-Black Trees** - Self-balancing tree implementation
- **Hash Tables** - Three implementations:
  - Universal hashing with chaining
  - Double hashing (open addressing)
  - Linear probing (open addressing)
- **Performance benchmarking** across all structures

### üï∏Ô∏è Graphs
- **Types**: Directed/Undirected, Weighted/Unweighted
- **Creation methods**: Manual input, random generation, file upload
- **Representations**: Adjacency lists and adjacency matrix
- **Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Topological Sort, Connected Components

## Implementation Details

### Sorting Algorithms Performance Test
- **Input sizes**: 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 elements
- **Runs**: 10 iterations per algorithm per size
- **Output**: Comparative charts and statistical analysis

### Data Structures Benchmark
- **Operations tested**: Insert, Search, Delete
- **Structures compared**: Arrays, Linked Lists, BST, Red-Black Trees
